Hi, welcome!

We are an interdisciplinary research team at the [Cambridge University Centre for Risk in the Built Environment](https://www.arct.cam.ac.uk/research/the-martin-centre/risk) and [AI for Environmental Risks](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/). Our aim is to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can provide an improved understanding of the global resilience in response to intensifying effects of climate change and other natural hazards. This project investigates state-of-the-art probabilistic catastrophe models and AI methods to quantify exposure and risk of the built environment at large scales, and would enable the beginnings of a **global risk audit**, measuring the changes of disaster risk profiles over time to assess whether countries are making progress.
